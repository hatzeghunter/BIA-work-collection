# Wildfire Operations Metrics & Scenario Planning

## Overview
Designed a data-driven wildfire response framework using operations
management principles, metrics, and scenario-based planning.

## Why this project
To address the increasing frequency and severity of wildfires in Canada
by defining measurable, actionable metrics that guide preparedness,
response, and post-event evaluation.

## Context
- Canadian provincial wildfire operations
- Climate-driven increase in wildfire risk
- Focus on early detection, resource readiness, and coordinated response

## Approach
- Applied Operations Management frameworks and metrics toolbox
- Designed KPIs across forecasting, execution, and evaluation phases
- Built two response scenarios:
  - Small but growing wildfire
  - Large, uncontrolled wildfire with evacuations
- Integrated benchmarking from Canada and international wildfire agencies

## Key Components
- Forecasting & early-warning metrics (FWI, weather, fire spread)
- Resource readiness (crews, equipment, aircraft, supply chain)
- Response-time and containment KPIs
- Management-by-Fact action plans for continuous improvement

## Key Takeaways
- Early detection and fast response significantly reduce escalation risk
- Large-scale fires require strong multi-agency coordination
- Metrics-driven planning improves accountability and cost efficiency
- Scenario-specific KPIs help adapt decisions as conditions change

## Tools
Operations Management frameworks, KPI design, scenario analysis,
presentation-based reporting
