# Global Wheat Trade Analysis

## Overview
Analyzed global wheat production, exports, and imports to identify key
countries driving supply, trade flows, and food security risks.

## Why this project
To understand how concentration in agricultural production and trade
exposes global food systems to climate, geopolitical, and policy disruptions.

## Data
- World Agricultural Outlook Board (WASDE) data
- Focus on major wheat-producing, exporting, and importing countries

## Approach
- Aggregated and compared wheat production across top countries
- Analyzed monthly export and import trends
- Identified disruptions and volatility in global trade flows
- Summarized findings through visual analysis and presentation

## Key Insights
- Wheat production is highly concentrated in a few countries (China, India, Russia)
- Russia dominates global wheat exports, influencing global prices
- China is the largest importer, showing resilient demand
- Sudden drops in trade volumes align with global disruptions
- Import-dependent countries face higher vulnerability to shocks

## Tools
Data analysis, visualization, presentation-based reporting
