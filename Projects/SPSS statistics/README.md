## Overview
Analyzed U.S. workforce survey data to understand earnings patterns,
demographics, job satisfaction, and workplace characteristics.

## Why this project
To apply statistical analysis techniques on real survey data and extract
meaningful workforce insights relevant to HR, labor economics, and policy.

## Data
- U.S. workforce survey data (SPSS & Excel)
- ~2,050 respondents
- Variables include earnings, education, age, union status, and job attitudes

## Analysis Performed
- Descriptive statistics (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis)
- Earnings analysis by education level
- Frequency and relative frequency analysis for age groups
- Comparison of unionized vs non-unionized worker earnings
- Creation of summated scales for job attitudes (career satisfaction, motivation)

## Key Insights

- Income distribution is highly skewed due to high-income outliers
- Majority of workers fall between ages 35–64
- No statistically significant income difference between unionized and non-unionized workers
- Job satisfaction and motivation scores show non-normal distributions
